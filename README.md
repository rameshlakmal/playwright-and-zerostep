End-to-end (E2E) testing is key to ensuring software works in real-life situations, but traditional methods can be complicated and easily break with small UI changes. ⚙️🚨 ZeroStep changes that by using AI 🤖 to improve Playwright tests. With ZeroStep, testers can automate tests using simple text commands ✍️, without needing to rely on complex selectors. ❌🔍 Powered by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, it makes testing faster ⏩, more reliable ✅, and less affected by UI updates. 🔄

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 🗝️

1️⃣ Uses the “ai()” function to understand plain-text instructions and decide the correct actions during runtime. 🤖💬
2️⃣ No need for locators, ensuring tests remain stable even as the app changes. 🚫🔍🔄
3️⃣ Built to integrate smoothly with Playwright, allowing AI to be added to existing tests without disrupting the development process. 🔧⚙️

𝗕𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗣𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀 👍
